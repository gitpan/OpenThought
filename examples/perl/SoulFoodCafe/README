This is a (silly) example of how you might use OpenThought for a real app.
Note that it makes use of CGI::Application, which is an excellent environment
for developing web apps.

It has a SoulFoodCafe instance script (.pl file) and class (.pm file), as well
as seperate HTML templates (using HTML::Template) for our seperation of code
and content needs :-)

The idea for this app came after watching the Blues Brothers one too many
times.  Having an online ordering site might prevent hooligans like Jake and
Elwood from going inside in the future (and the addition of a computer means he
could have simply emailed Matt guitar Murphy anyhow, rather than tracking him
down on foot!)
