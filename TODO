OpenThought Engine TODO List                            http://openthought.net

* Write instructions for getting OpenThought to work on Windows
* Write plugins and sample usages of OpenThought utilizing languages other then
  Perl.  For example, plugins might use SOAP, Jabber, XML-RPC, etc.
* Implement DHTML Tabs to switch between application screens
* Write (or find an existing) a better mod_perl handler for OpenThought use.
  Apache::Registry works fabulously, but we could use something smaller and
  more efficient, perhaps sacrificing some error checking.
