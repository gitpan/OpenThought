OpenThought Engine TODO List                            http://openthought.net
----------------------------                           eric at openthought.net

* Write instructions for getting OpenThought to work on Windows
* Write plugins and sample usages of OpenThought utilizing languages other then
  Perl.  For example, plugins might use SOAP, Jabber, XML-RPC, etc.
* Create an optional form validation system which looks for oddities with a
  given form that might cause OpenThought problems
* Better error checking of config file values
* Better error checking of the JavaScript routines: in particular, some sort of
  useful error should show up if an element can't be found
* Build a CPAN bundle for OpenThought (which, of course, contains all of
  OpenThought's dependencies)
* Move templates and modules out of OpenThoughtRoot
