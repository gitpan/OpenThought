OpenThought is a powerful and flexible web application environment.
OpenThought applications are different from other web applications in that all
communication between the browser and the server is performed in the
background.  This gives a browser the ability to receive data from the server
without ever reloading the currently loaded document.  Data received can be
displayed automatically on the existing page, can access JavaScript functions
and variables, and can load new pages.  Additionally, OpenThought completely
manages all of your session data for you.  These features give the look and
feel of a full-blown application instead of just an ordinary Web page.

Uses Apache 1.3.x / mod_perl 1.2.x or CGI / Perl 5

Currently known to work with:
 Netscape 4.x, 6.x
 Mozilla 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 1.x
 IE 4.x, 5.x, 6.x
 Opera 6.x
 Konqueror 3.x

After installation, use 'perldoc OpenThought' for instructions on how to create
applications using OpenThought.  Additionally, you can use the demo application
as an example.

Requires the following Perl Packages:
 Apache::Request
 HTML::Template
 OpenPlugin
 OpenThought::XML2Hash
 XML::Parser
